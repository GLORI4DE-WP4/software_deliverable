Notes on the download from S3
--------------------------------------

The "donwload_lam_from_s3.py" script requires credentials, stored into a file named "cred.txt" placed in this folder.
The structure of this file should be as follows:

[default]
aws_access_key_id = [put_the_key_id_here]
aws_secret_access_key = [put_the_access_key_here]
