--------------------------------------

Scenario 1 can be divided into three components:
- dowload of the initial condition for the global run from S3
- global run performed using a BACY cycle
- LAM run performed calling the individual module (int2lm and more).

The ecFLow suite is generated by the script "define_scenario_1.py" inside the "ecflow_suite" subdirectory.
More information on how to run the scenario for an example case are provided in the tutorial document.
