Notes on the content of this directory
--------------------------------------

Thsi directory contains the data assimilation for the Scenario 2.
The ecFLow suite is generated by the script "define_scenario_2.py" inside the "ecflow_suite" subdirectory.
This suite is particularly simple, since it contains only one call to a BACY cycle.

More information on how to run the scenario for an example case are provided in the tutorial document.
