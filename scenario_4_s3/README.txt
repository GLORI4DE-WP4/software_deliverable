Notes on the content of this directory
--------------------------------------

Thsi directory contains the Scenario 4 initialized from the DWD analysis, downloaded from S3.
The ecFLow suite is generated by the script "define_scenario_4.py" inside the "ecflow_suite" subdirectory.
This suite performs the donwload from S3, and then calls the BACY cycle, which performs the model run.

More information on how to run the scenario for an example case are provided in the tutorial document.
