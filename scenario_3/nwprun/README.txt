Notes on the content of this directory
--------------------------------------

After installing nwprun, this folder is automatically filled with the scripts and templates used for generating the ecFlow suite.
In this repository, we included the configuration and templates used for the definition of the suite associated with scenario 3.
Make sure that the files provided in this repositoy overwrite the ones from the standard nwprun installation.
