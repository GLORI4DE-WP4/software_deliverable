Notes on the content of this directory
--------------------------------------

This directory has been included in the repository since it is used to place the example files for the visualization.
In a normal model run, BACY would create a subdirectory containing the output forecast.

When running the example visualization, create a directory here called "20241019060000" and place the LAM output (grid number R19B07) inside it.
